Over the holiday, I've added a few tools to the [NXT Tools](http://github.com/jbryan/nxt-tools) I've been developing.  One is a simple python tool to use gstreamer to convert any gstreamer readable audio format to the NXT's native RSO format.  Also I've added a very basic tool to use a computer to interface a Wii remote (aka wiimote) to the NXT brick.
