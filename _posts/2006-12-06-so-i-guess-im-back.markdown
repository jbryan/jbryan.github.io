After a long hiatus, I am going to try my hand at keeping up with this blog again.  I'm not sure how it will go, but I have good intentions.  I've been rather busy with work, moving, getting married, applying to grad school, studying for the GRE, and generally living.  I have a few projects that I've been working on and this seems like a decent place to announce and discuss them.  In addition, there have been some interesting things in the news recently that are probably worth writing about.  I am, after all, paying for this hosting, and somebody is paying for adds on it, so I might as well get some use and or revenue from it.  Hopefully, this will be the first in a string of much more frequent postings.

As I mentioned, I recently got married to Jennifer Benoit-Bryan.  [Here ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joshbryan/) are some pictures.  We went on a honeymoon to Turks and Caicos.  After we got back, it was studying for the GRE and working hard.  It seems things may be easing off a little now, so hopefully I'll have some time for my own projects.
