I recently put together a short demo about Q learning and SARSA learning for a class I was taking.  The demo involved running the two algorithms in parallel in a simple maze world.  The world, the agent, and the learned Q function are drawn using OpenGL.  

A few people suggested I make the presentation and demo code available for others, so here it is:  You can download the code for the [reinforcement learning demo](http://github.com/jbryan/rl_demo) from GitHub, and I have attached the [presentation](/files/presentation.pdf)  as well.
