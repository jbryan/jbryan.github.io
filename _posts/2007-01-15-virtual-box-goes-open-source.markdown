[Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org) had an [article](http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/75632880/article.pl) today pointing out that [Virtual Box](http://www.virtualbox.org) has made their project GPL OSS.  This makes one of the first completely open source desktop virtualization solutions.  I have been a fan of [vmware](http://www.vmware.com), even though they are only partially open source, and their workstation product is rather expensive.  I hav used [Xen](http://www.xensource.com), but issues with display drivers make it difficult to use as desktop virtualization (though nvidia has said they will support it "some time in the future").
