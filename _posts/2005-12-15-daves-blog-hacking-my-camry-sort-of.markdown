Today, I found a useful tip about my newly aquired 2005 Toyota Corolla.  [Dave's BLOG: Hacking my Camry (sort of)](http://djaquay.blogspot.com/2005/10/hacking-my-camry-sort-of.html) is an article that explains how to turn off the MAINT REQD light when the mainenance people forget to.  The manual and all of the docs I found say that this light only comes on when the car thinks it is due for an oil change.  So, if the oil change shop forgets to reset it , it will come on an warn about nothing.  The solution:




<blockquote>     

> 
>   

>   * Turn key to Acc  

>   * Hold odometer push-button in  

>   * Turn key to On  

>   * Watch the odometer reading turn to dashes  

>   * Watch the dashes slowly disappear  

>   * When the dashes all go away, and turn to zeroes, release the odometer button  

> </blockquote>



Hope somebody finds this useful...thanks dave.
