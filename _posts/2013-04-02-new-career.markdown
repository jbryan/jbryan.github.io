Recently I did something crazy.  I left a great job at University of Chicago developing [data transfer software for the research community](https://www.globusonline.org) to start my own company.  The company, [Clear Abacus](http://www.clearabacus.com), will be providing a software-as-as-service supply chain optimization engine that facilitates transport routing and loading decisions.  I am looking forward to all the challenges that lie ahead, both technical and personal.
