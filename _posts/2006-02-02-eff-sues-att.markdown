I just saw this article, [Macworld: News: EFF sues AT&T; over U.S. wiretapping program](http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/02/01/effatt/index.php), and found it interesting.  Even though I beleive the organizations really at fault here are the NSA and other Bush administration entities, I'm glad to see that some groups have the rights of the people in mind.  Now if we can just get congress to act with equal enthusiasm.
