Recently, I read [Freakonomics](http://www.freakonomics.com/) by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.  This book did an excellent job balancing simplicity and thoroughness while tackling what is traditionally viewed as a dry topic.  Levitt's unique approach to economics provides many insights into modern society and human behavior.  His analysis of topics ranges from a rare inside looks at Chicago gang finances to a politically difficult, yet scientifically sound, correlation between Roe Vs. Wade and the drop in crime in the early 1990's.  Dubner and Levitt guide the reader through these topics in a clear, precise, and exciting manner that makes to book one of the best I've read recently.
