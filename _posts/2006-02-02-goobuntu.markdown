NewsFactor.com's article, [Google Downplays Goobuntu Linux Rumor - Tech Trends - NewsFactor Network](http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=001000000VX1), is more rumbling about the possibility of Google selling it's own operating system. Though I would certainly be among the first to try it out if they did, Google has made no public disclosure that they have plans to do so. Furthermore, with MacOS X being positioned as a great UNIX operating system with all the touchy feely GUI details the average consumer looks for, and able to run on at least two architectures, I imagine for Google to be competitive in this business would be very difficult. Don't get me wrong, I use Linux and love it, but I also see why most people don't. If you are just looking for a "Not MS" OS, why not Mac OS?
