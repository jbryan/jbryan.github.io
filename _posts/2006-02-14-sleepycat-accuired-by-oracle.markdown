In [news](http://news.com.com/Oracle+snaps+up+open-source+database+firm/2100-7344_3-6039070.html) today, Oracle bought Berkeley DB maker Sleepycat.Â  This news comes a few months after their announcement that they purchased Innobase, makers of the MySQL innodb engine.Â  Though, it hasn't announced plans to discontinue, irreversibly incorporate, or otherwise dissrupt their open use, it does raise questions about _what_ Oracle plans to do with them.

As an avid user and supporter of opensource software, my worst nightmare would be that the tools I use everyday would be licensed in such away I can no longer use them.Â  I highly doubt Oracle could close these projects up with out a huge outcry from the OSS community.Â  It just leaves us all guessing about what will happen.
