Ben Bryan is a Chicago area photographer, and my brother, who has recently launched a website for his business, [Aerosol Wax Photography](http://aerosolwax.com).  Though most of the site has been designed by him, I am currently working with him as consultant / backend engineer to expand the site into the world of e-commerce.

As an artist, Ben has a broad spectrum of experience ranging from fine art cinematography to event photography.  His current business is focused on pet photography and wedding photography, but will soon branch out to include online sales of some of his fine art pieces.
