Today I finally downloaded Google's Firefox [Blogger Web Comments](http://toolbar.google.com/firefox/extensions/index.html) extension. The plugin searches the web for blogger articles relevant to your current browser location. Though it is not perfect, it often comes up with very relevent results. Though this is certainly a cool toy for random perusal of the internet, I am not yet sure it will prove very useful for targeted searches for information. I've found the pages it suggests to be convenient distractions from what my original search intent may have been. However, that being said, it certainly is fun and worth checking out.
