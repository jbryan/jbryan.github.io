This morning I lauded Microsoft for their recent unveil, [Local Live](http://local.live.com/), however, I somehow missed Google's unveil, [Google Transit](http://google.com/transit).  Though this is only in beta, and unfortunately only supports the Portland area, this is the extension to [maps](http://maps.google.com) I have always wanted since moving to Chicago. This would be a huge improvement over the CTA's current [trip planner](http://tripsweb.rtachicago.com/). I sincerely hope plans for expanding this project are short in coming. Nice job google!
