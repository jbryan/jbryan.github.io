I have been rather busy recently, but I thought I'd give an update about my personal life.  I just received confirmation that I have been accepted into the masters program in computer science at [UIC.](http://www.uic.edu)  I will start in the fall, but I will be moving closer to campus in a few weeks.  I plan on continuing my freelance work while attending classes, but have not yet figured out how much of my time can be devoted to that.  Our new house will be on the W Fillmore St just off Western Ave.  This puts us on the very western edge of the [UIC Medical District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_West_Side,_Chicago#University_Village_Chicago).  My cell and other contact infomation will remain unchanged.
