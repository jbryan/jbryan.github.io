[ZDnet](http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/index.php?p=119) had an article about Microsoft recently launching their [Office Live](http://officelive.microsoft.com/) product. Though it looks very slick, I don't see it replacing more traditional office software soon. If for no other reason than the fact that people will not want to upload data too, and download data from, a web service all the time. Further more, Office Live has several features that require Microsoft Office to be installed on the user's machine. If they have Office, why use Office Live? Also, it won't serve as a route for Microsoft to expand into office software on other platforms as Office Live requires IE. It might be a convenient companion service to Microsoft Office, but I doubt it will become much more.
