About four months ago, I was introduced to [Mojavi](http://mojavi.org), an MVC
(Model-View-Controller) framework for [PHP](http://php.net).  This, after three
years of programming in PHP, has been the cleanest solution I've found to
systematic separation of business and display logic.  It allows you to define
your web application in terms of discrete modules with actions that can be
performed.  Any given action will result and any of a number of views depending
on input from and state of the user.

Though, at first, the framework is less than intuitive, it is quite powerful
and flexible.  It provides built in support for different databases, templating
systems ([Smarty](http://www.smarty.net) and [Smart
Templates](http://www.smartparser.com/)), input, post and pre filters, action
chains, custom error handling, and path style get variables for
[SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seo).  The biggest drawback I found is that
there exist few good "How-To's" about it.  

If you do web development, you should check it out.  I've been using it at work
and personally and find it incredibly useful.  If you have questions, feel free
to ask.
