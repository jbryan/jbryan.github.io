I just thought I'd announce that today, one of the projects I've been working on recently went live.  [Yo Journal](http://www.yojournal.com) is an online personal journal that allows you to keep track of daily entries, categorize those entries, and also keep track of specific types of data like weight, movies, and books.  To read more about Yo Journal, you should visit the [about page](http://www.yojournal.com/about), or the [tour](http://www.yojournal.com/about/tour).  There is a free edition as well as an expanded version for pay that adds features like file uploads and categories.
