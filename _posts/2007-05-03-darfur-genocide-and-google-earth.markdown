A joint project between [Google](http://www.google.com) and the [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](http://www.ushmm.org/) provides an [interactive way to learn about the crisis in Darfur](http://www.ushmm.org/googleearth/).Â  This is definately one of the coolest applications of Google Earth I've seen.
