I've been a little busy ... well, very busy ... this last year, so here is a
little update about projects in my life.   I finished up my masters thesis this
last semester, and started work toward my Ph.D. in computer science at
[UIC](http://www.uic.edu).  I am researching rationality in multiagent settings
for the UIC Multi Agent Systems laboratory.  Particularly, I am looking at ways
to update POMDP models from agent experience.   Between school, various
freelance projects, and a short year long career at
[CashNetUSA](http://www.cashnetusa.com), I've been pretty busy and haven't been
posting much, hopefully that will change.
