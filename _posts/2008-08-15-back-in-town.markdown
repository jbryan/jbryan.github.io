I just returned from a month long vacation in Europe.  My wife and I took a budget (hostels and Easy Jet) tour of Europe starting in Ireland, and moving through Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Germany, and England.  The trip was a blast, but I'm still glad to be back home.  You can see [pictures of our trip](http://picasaweb.google.com/jenniferbenoit/EuropeTripHighlights) on Jen's Picasa album.  

While on the trip, I decided to spend more time maintaining this blog.  We will see how strong my resolve to do so really is in the next few months.  However, since I am paying for the blog, I may as well make more regular use of it.  In addition, I think the writing could prove to be therapeutic.
