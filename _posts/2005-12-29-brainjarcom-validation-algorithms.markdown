I found this useful bit of code today for an [ABA check validation algorithm](http://www.brainjar.com/js/validation/). After realizing that aba routing numbers don't use the same LUHN10 check that creditcards do, I searched and found that it is a similar but different algorithm.  Hope somebody finds it useful.
