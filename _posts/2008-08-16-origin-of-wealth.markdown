[Origin of Wealth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOrigin-Wealth-Evolution-Complexity-Economics%2Fdp%2F157851777X&tag=josbry-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=josbry-20&l=ur2&o=1) is a very entertaining and captivating survey of recent developments in economics.  He repeatedly takes traditional economic theories to task for failing to match real world empirical data while painting a picture of the economy as a complex, adaptive, and evolutionary system rather than the traditional overly simplistic system of market equilibrium.  This is definitely worthwhile read.
