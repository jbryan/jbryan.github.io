I teach drum lessons for beginning through advanced students.  I personally have been playing for over 12 years. I have experience performing in marching bands, concert bands, orchestras, jazz ensembles, latin bands, and rock bands.  I currently am playing congas and percussion with [The Banana Oil Pan Band](http://www.bananaoilpanband.com), Mid Missouri's only steel pan band. I also have written for and taught the Rock Bridge High School marching drumline and pit from 2000 until 2004

I currently live in the west Chicago area and work in Schaumburg, IL.  Since I live in an apartment building, I don't have a great place to teach, but I am will to give lessons at student's houses.  I charge $25 an hour for lessons, and have experience in all concert percussion, including keyboard instruments.  Also, I teach drumset and hand percussion.  If you are interested, you may contact me at [josh.bryan@gmail.com](mailto:josh.bryan@gmail.com) or (773)852-8733 to schedule a drum lesson. Also, posting a comment to this page will get my attention.
