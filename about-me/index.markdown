I am a 28 year old computer programmer and musician living and working in Chicago, IL. Currently I pursuing a PhD artificial intelligence at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  My research focus is in rational decision making in multiagent systems.  I have extensive experience in Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, HTML, SQL, Java, and Javascript on Linux and MS Windows platforms.  I have developed interactive Ajax driven database applications for several clients.

Also, I play music. I am currently looking for fellow musicians to play with. I have over 15 years of performance experience as a drummer and percussionist playing with groups ranging from grunge rock bands to jazz combos and chamber orchestras to calypso steel drum bands. I also have about 6 years of teaching experience and am willing to give lessons. If you are interested in playing, taking lessons, or just chatting about music, feel free to contact [me](mailto:josh.bryan@gmail.com?subject=Music).

This website serves as a repository for my thoughts, projects, and information. The site will be undergoing a lot of change over the next few months as I slowly figure out how I want to organize it, but for now, feel free to browse or contact me about any thing you find.
