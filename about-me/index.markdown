I am a 33 year old computer programmer and musician living and working in Chicago, IL. I have several years of software development and research experience in academia.  My main research foci and interests are in rational decision making in multiagent systems.  I have extensive experience in Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, HTML, SQL, Java, and Javascript on Linux and MS Windows platforms.  I have developed interactive web applications for several clients.

I have a variety of hobbies that include scuba diving, beer brewing, programming, running, and music. This website serves as a repository for my thoughts, projects, and information. Free to browse or contact me about any thing you find.
